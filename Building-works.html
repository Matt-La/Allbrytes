		<h2>Alterations and refurbishments</h2>
		<p>When timing is tight on alteration and refurbishment projects, you need a builder that is not only reliable but has the wealth of experience to work safely and competently under pressure.
		   Allbryte will not only fulfil those requirements, but we also ask all the important questions from the outset.  As the contractor, we need the best understanding of what you need, so that we can provide helpful insights and proactive suggestions - 
		   at the planning stage and throughout.</p>
		<h2>New builds</h2>
		<p>With new builds we will often establish the build criteria ourselves and then appoint an architect to work with us on the project. Together we produce plans for the client that match the size and type of building plot available, and we also interpret fully the aims of the client.</p>
		<h2>Loft conversions</h2>
		<p>Our experience at converting lofts within the Buckinghamshire area means that we can tackle the more complicated projects, as well as window casing and staircases.
			We have a team of dedicated contractors to take care of all the electrical and plumbing work to give you the perfect finish.</p><br>
