		<h1>We are a Family Run Company with a wealth of experience</h1>
		<p>Simon is the founder of Allbryte.  A 3rd generation builder within a family of builders and has worked in the industry for some 27 years gaining qualifications in all trades and has spent many years working in each trade gaining experience.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Simon's partner in Allbryte, Sharon, is also his life partner and together they work to make sure that all the needs of Allbryte's customers and employees are met and try to make the work as efficient and painless as possible.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As a small construction business we pride ourselves on delivering first class customer service and we believe it is important to maintain healthy working relationships with our customers.  We want happy customers who would recommend us to their family and friends. 
			 We have the proven ability to meet tight, client driven deadlines by managing our workload effectively, prioritising well and working through challenges.</p><br>
			<p>How do you know we're not just any old building firm waffling empty words at you? Well, to add transparency to our business we have gone on Twitter
			and Facebook so you can follow our current projects.  We understand that social media keeps us in the spotlight and we know we have to get customer satisfaction right, otherwise we would see our company grind to a halt.
			 Recently we have added slide shows in our project gallery giving you an insight into past work and we have also gone the extra mile to set up site visits so you can come and check out our current project we're working on and chat with the owners to get the lowdown at first hand.</p><br>
